#How to Print with FilaFlex and other Flexible Filaments

It's been seven months that we've printed FilaFlex with multiple printers and kicked out 3D printed shoes of all shapes and sizes here at SLEM.  Flexible Filaments are definitely on the advance side of 3D, but we've come up with a few tricks to make it easier here at SLEM. 

##Prequel
Make sure your printer is square, lubricated and calibrated. 

##The Spice Must Flow
Filament backing up in the Hot End is BAD. BAD BAD BAD.  SUPER BAD. JUST BAD. 
 Even if it's just the first layer being 0.1mm to close to the board it causes a strange form of stopple to start in the head that will kill the print. It doesn't happen immediately, it just causes a backup in the head that will kill you later.  If you pull up the head and lots of Filament comes out something was causing stopple blockage.  

###Good Leveling
Levelling is key to prevent topple blockage.  The first layer is 80% of a good print.  Get that down well and your chance of success is high.  

##Start is Big
Especially if you are printing at 0.1mm resolution, The first layer needs to me 0.28mm.  Adhesion is key.  Let me repeat 80% of good print is getting a good first layer.  

##Put it in the Hole
There is an old saying taught to me by Recreus, "You can't push a rope". But that is what we are doing with flexible filaments.  We are squeezing them into a tube and melting them into place.  If the tubes are misaligned by even a milimeter the filament can crimp out and wrap around the drive wheel.  Be sure to double check everything is aligned perfectly.  

###Brush Your Teeth
The teeth on your drive wheel can scrape off material, any kind of material.  Be sure to take them off and brush them regularly, be sure to put them back in perfect alignment.

## Like it HOT HOT HOT
Temperature needs to be constant.  Run FilaFlex at 250 C because electricity from the grid is not as constant as it needs to be.  Use Pronterface or Repteir to monitor your Temps and prepare to be stunned.  
###Avoid the Kettle
Any heavy power consuming device on the same circuit as your printer spells DOOM for good printing.  One of my colleagues at SLEM liked to print in the evening and once everything was started she wold have a nice cup of tea.   Little did we know the electricity in our building was wired strangely and the kitchen and our Lab were on the same circuit.  Nearly every time she turned the Kettle on it would draw enough Amps to cause the printer to cool down.  This would cause the afore mentioned topple to start happening and ruin the print.  My poor colleague was nearly driven crazy because during the day when were were around everything went fine (no tea) and in the evening all went to hell.  An expensive visit from the Electrician later we learned the cause.  
### You got to keep em separated
The same thing happens when you put several printers on the same circuit.  Three printers heating at the same time on the same circuit saps the Amps and cools the heads to a temperature that causes stopple.
###But get it cold fast
Dimensional stability comes from the material solidifying in position as fast as possible.  Fans are key.  Turn off your fans if you are having heating problems, but once the heating problems are sorted out get them on again.  It would be great if someone cold program the Fan to stop (or Slow) if the temperature dips below 240C. 

## Move to 2.85mm Filament
Larger filament is easier to hold on to and move thru the Hot End.
